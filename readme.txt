Automatically create FPO blog posts to help your WordPress design and development process.

== Description ==

Create FPO blog posts to help your WordPress design and development process. This plugin creates randomly-generated content (via Markov chains from various sources) and creates for placement only posts. All posts are tagged #wp-fpo so you can easily find and delete them when necessary.

A few generic text sources (Lorem Ipsum, the US Constitution, and MLK's Letter From A Birmingham Jail) are available for selection.

== Installation ==

The installation process is the same as all WP plugins:

1. Download and unzip the plugin file
2. Upload 'wp-fpo' directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin for? =

I use WP for lots of skeleton site builds -- and the default "hello world" post isn't enough to build a theme or create a design around. This plugin uses generic text sources to create a user-defined number of fake posts. Simple.

= How should I report a bug? =

You can submit bugs directly to the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/husani/wp-fpo/issues) list.

= How can I contribute code? =
